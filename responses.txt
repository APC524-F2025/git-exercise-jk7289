Problem 1:

The file polynomial_zeros.ipynb doesn't appear in the commit
part1-squash because I removed the file from the repository (git rm)
before making that commit. This is not affected by my addition of
"*.ipynb" to the .gitignore file: this just prevents such files from 
being staged in the future. If added now, it wouldn't be tracked by git.
After all this, the file no longer shows up in following commits.

Problem 2:

I have kept the changes that Iris made to her test file for two reasons. First,
she set out to make those changes specifically. Meanwhile, Frank fixed the test
file among other additions that he was making, namely orthogonality tests.
Branches should, in general, be made for doing one thing particular, then merged.
Her code seems more streamlined and purpose-built. Second, her work is easier
to merge, because git is not picking up on most of Frank's changes in the merge
process. It's still possible to use his functions and the new added dependency on 
pytest, but it is much easier to just keep 'current changes', since not all the
'incoming changes' that would be needed to make the code work are brought up by 
git merge, and manual merging labor is unappealing.

Problem 3:

Frank's idea is great, and it would make managing their report much easier.
Each student's file can be edited on its own without touching files being edited
by other people; when it comes time to merge, GitHub can simply handle changes
to each individual file without the need for manual ordering in a merge.
Meanwhile, the LaTeX file itself can be modified to change the order of these
sections alone, which is also a very simple change. Altogether, Frank's system
would be easier to work on for a team of people, and would make it easier to 
track changes.

Problem 4:

It seems that our tests fail after the merge because legroot.py was modified to 
include Fraction in addition to Decimal types through its functions. However,
existing code still expects Decimals. So, we get TypeErrors trying to operate 
with mixes of Decimals and Fractions.

Commands:
I produced this list because I had restart my repo more than once.
I have left it here for better grading in case this helps you!
